# Memory

To use the memory as optimal as possible some parts need to be constructed:

- Optimization
- Initialization
- Garbage collection

## Function list

| Function      | Description                |
|---------------|:--------------------------:|

## How is it going to work?

To make optimal use out of the memory there will be decoding/encoding used to make the saved string shorter.

Caching on global level will be used too to save load time on long-term storage.

### Initialization

When a memory object not instantiated correctly it will be instantiated. There will be a switch case to fullfil the different memory needs for the different memory object types.

### Garbage collection

When a memory object is not going to be used anymore it gets removed to save memory space.
