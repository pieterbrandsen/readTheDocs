Console commands
================

When a creep does a new action the creep should say something to show the user what it is doing.

The following parts will be included:

- Function
- On/off switch
- Console log toggle

Function list

Things a creep can say

.. csv-table::
  :header: Short text, Description, When
  :widths: 30 50 20

How is it going to work?

There we will be one single acces point to fulfill the toggle switches.

When the function is off nothing gets executed and only when console logging is allowed for creep sayings the console gets used too.
